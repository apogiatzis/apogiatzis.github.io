                <ul>
                    <li>Every problem has an assigned point value, which is usually representative of our perceived
                        difficulty of the problem. Your total score is the sum of the points you obtain from every problem
                        you solve.</li>
                    <li>In case of ties, the time taken to solve the challenges will be used as the tie-breaker.</li>
                    <li>There are no bonus points, so do not attempt to find hidden flags outside of the challenges.</li>
                    <li>During the CTF, the scoreboard will display rankings on a per-group basis. After the competition
                        ends, we will release the top 10 overall participants.</li>

            <p>
                If you happen to be oblivious to rule 2 and discover a vulnerability within the domains of the CTF infrastructure, then we urge you to e-mail us in private so we can
fix it and everyone else can enjoy the fun.
We will give you credit once the competition has finished and buy you a cookie and some coffee.
You will also earn our respect, which is hard to come by.
